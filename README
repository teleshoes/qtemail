  src/email-gui.py
    simple python QT gui (pyside+QML)
      essentially a wrapper around email.pl
    should work anywhere QT/python/perl work with little effort
    explicitly supported platforms:
      Meego Harmattan
      Debian GNU/Linux
    QML is located in /opt/email-gui/

  src/email.pl
    simple command line IMAP client
    caches all headers, and caches unread bodies
    e.g.:
      > echo "configure $HOME/.secrets first"
        configure /home/wolke/.secrets and run 'email.pl'
      >
      > email.pl
      GMail: logging in

Usage:
===== email.pl =====

  Simple IMAP client. {--smtp command is a convenience wrapper around smtp-cli}
  Configuration is in ~/.secrets
    Each line is one key of the format: email.ACCOUNT_NAME.FIELD = value
    Account names can be any word characters (alphanumeric plus underscore)
    Other keys are ignored.
    required fields:
      user     {Required} IMAP username, usually the full email address
      password {Required} *password in plaintext*
      server   {Required} IMAP server
      port     {Required} IMAP server port
      ssl      {Optional} false to forcibly disable security
      inbox    {Optional} main IMAP folder name to use (default is "INBOX")
      sent     {Optional} IMAP folder name to use for sent mail
      folders  {Optional} colon-separated list of additional folders to fetch
        each folder has a FOLDER_NAME,
        which is the directory on the filesystem will be lowercase
        FOLDER_NAME is the folder, with all non-alphanumeric characters
          replaced with _s, and all leading and trailing _s removed
        e.g.:  junk:[GMail]/Drafts:_12_/ponies
               =>  ["junk", "gmail_drafts", "12_ponies"]

  ACCOUNT_NAME    the word following "email." in ~/.secrets
  FOLDER_NAME     "inbox", "sent" or one of the names from "folders"
  UID             an IMAP UID {UIDVALIDITY is assumed to never change}

        -fetch and write all message UIDs to

        -fetch and cache all message headers in
          ~/.cache/email/ACCOUNT_NAME/FOLDER_NAME/headers/UID
        -fetch and cache bodies according to bodyCacheMode config
            all    => every header that was cached gets its body cached
            unread => every unread message gets its body cached
            none   => no bodies are cached
          ~/.cache/email/ACCOUNT_NAME/FOLDER_NAME/bodies/UID
        -fetch all unread messages and write their UIDs to
          ~/.cache/email/ACCOUNT_NAME/FOLDER_NAME/unread
        -write all message UIDs that are now in unread and were not before
          ~/.cache/email/ACCOUNT_NAME/FOLDER_NAME/new-unread
        -run /opt/qtemail/bin/email-search.pl --updatedb ACCOUNT_NAME FOLDER_NAME 100
    -update global unread counts file ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
      ignored or missing accounts are preserved in ~/.cache/email/unread-counts

      write the unread counts, one line per account, to ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
      e.g.: 3:AOL
            6:GMAIL
            0:WORK_GMAIL

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --folders ACCOUNT_NAME
    format and print information about each folder for the given account
    "FOLDER_NAME:<unread_count>/<total_count>"

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --header [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] ACCOUNT_NAME UID [UID UID ...]
    format and print the header of the indicated message(s)
    prints each of [Date Subject From To]
      one per line, formatted "UID.FIELD: VALUE"

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --body [--no-download] [-0] [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] ACCOUNT_NAME UID [UID UID ...]
    download, format and print the body of the indicated message(s)
    if -0 is specified, print a NUL character after each body instead of a newline
    if body is cached, skip download
    if body is not cached and --no-download is specified, use empty string for body
      instead of downloading the body
    if message has a plaintext and HTML component, only one is returned
    if preferHtml is false, plaintext is returned, otherwise, HTML

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --body-plain [--no-download] [-0] [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] ACCOUNT_NAME UID [UID UID ...]
    same as --body, but override preferHtml=false,
      and attempt to convert the result to plaintext if it appears to be HTML
      (uses /usr/bin/html2text if available, or just strips out the tags)

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --body-html [--no-download] [-0] [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] ACCOUNT_NAME UID [UID UID ...]

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --print [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] [ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_NAME ...]
    format and print cached unread message headers and bodies
    fetches bodies like "/opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --body-plain --no-download",
      similarly converting HTML to plaintext
    formats whitespace in bodies, compressing multiple empty lines to a max of 2,
      and prepending every line with 2 spaces

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --summary [--folder=FOLDER_NAME] [ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_NAME ...]
    format and print cached unread message headers

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --status-line [ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_NAME ...]
    {cached in ~/.cache/email/status-line when ~/.cache/email/unread-counts or error files change}
    does not fetch anything, merely reads ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
    format and print ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
    the string is a space-separated list of the first character of
      each account name followed by the integer count
    no newline character is printed
    if the count is zero for a given account, it is omitted
    if accounts are specified, all but those are omitted
    e.g.: A3 G6

  /opt/qtemail/bin/email.pl --status-short [ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_NAME ...]
    {cached in ~/.cache/email/status-short when ~/.cache/email/unread-counts or error files change}
    does not fetch anything, merely reads ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
    format and print ~/.cache/email/unread-counts
    if accounts are specified, all but those are omitted
    omits accounts with unread-count of 0

    the string is two lines, each always containing exactly three characters
    no line can be longer than 3, and if it is shorter, it is left-padded with spaces
    each line ends in a newline character

    if any account has error, prints:
      "ERR", "<total>"
    if any account has more then 99 emails, prints
      "big", "<total>"
    if more than two accounts have a positive unread-count, prints:
      "all", "<total>"
    if exactly two accounts have a positive unread-count, prints:
      "<acc><count>", "<acc><count>"
    if exactly one account has a positive unread-count, prints:
      "<acc><count>", ""
    otherwise, prints:
      "", ""

    <total> = total of all unread counts if less than 1000, or '!!!' otherwise
    <acc> = first character of a given account name
    <count> = unread count for the indicated account

    modifies ~/.secrets
    for each KEY/VAL pair:
      removes any line that matches "email.ACCOUNT_NAME.KEY\s*="
